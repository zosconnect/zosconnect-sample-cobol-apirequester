# Sample CICS application for z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE)

This repository contains a sample CICS COBOL application that uses the API Requester function of z/OS Connect EE to call a health insurance claim rule API hosted on the IBM Cloud.  The CICS application is invoked as a REST API using z/OS Connect EE.

![Diagram 1](https://github.com/zosconnect/zosconnect-sample-cobol-apirequester/blob/master/media/DiagFlow.png)

## Prerequisites

* z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition is installed and a z/OS Connect EE instance has been created and configured with the [CICS Service Provider](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/configuring/cics_service_provider.html) and the [API Requester function](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/configuring/config_zCEE_apireq.html). 
* CICS Transaction Server v5.2 or later 
* The CICS region is running and [configured to access z/OS Connect EE to call APIs](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/configuring/config_cics_commstub.html).
* Enterprise COBOL Compiler

## Installing

* Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:zosconnect/zosconnect-sample-cobol-apirequester.git`
* Allocate a PDS with 30 tracks for the jobs and sample source files

```text
Average record unit
Primary quantity  . . 30
Secondary quantity    5
Directory blocks  . . 10
Record format . . . . FB
Record length . . . . 80
Block size  . . . . . 27920
Data set name type    PDS
```

* Upload the following source and sample JCLs to your z/OS system and store on the PDS that was allocated

```text
claimci0.cbl
claiminf.cpy
claimreq.cpy
claimrqc.cpy
claimrsc.cpy
claimrsp.cpy
cicsdefn.jcl
compile.jcl
vsam.jcl
```

* Customize the uploaded copy of **compile.jcl** for your environment and submit to compile the sample CICS COBOL program. The load module should be installed on a PDSE library that is accessible to the CICS region. Additional instructions are provided in the sample JCL. The expected return code is **0**.

* Customize the uploaded copy of **vsam.jcl** for your environment and submit to define the VSAM data set used by the CICS program. Additional instructions are provided in the sample JCL. The expected return code is **0**.

* Customize the uploaded copy of **ciscdefn.jcl** for your environment and submit to define the CICS resources. Additional instructions are provided in the sample JCL. The expected return code is **0**.

## Configuring

* Create the following directories (if not done yet) called **resources/zosconnect/services**, **resources/zosconnect/apis**, and **resources/zosconnect/apiRequesters** under your server path.
  ```text
  /var/zosconnect/servers/<server-name>/resources/zosconnect/services
  /var/zosconnect/servers/<server-name>/resources/zosconnect/apis
  /var/zosconnect/servers/<server-name>/resources/zosconnect/apiRequesters
  ```
* Recursively chown and chmod the output directories so your z/OS Connect server ID has access to them.
  ```sh
  cd /var/zosconnect/servers/<server-name>
  chown -R <serverID>:<serverGroup> ./resources
  chmod -R 750 ./resources
  ```

* Setup definitions for the API Requester end-point (outbound) and the CICS IPIC connection (inbound) in server.xml. The server.xml should have the following entries added.
  ```xml
  <zosconnect_endpointConnection id="nodejsClaims"
     host="claims-rule-node-demo.mybluemix.net"
     port="80"/>

  <zosconnect_cicsIpicConnection id="zconipic"
  	 host="<hostname>"
  	 port="<portnum>"/>
  ```

**NOTE:** Change the hostname and portnum to the actual hostname and port number of the CICS region where the CICS sample program (CLAIMCI0) was installed. A sample server.xml is included in the package. If you want to use the sample server.xml file then upload it to z/OS in binary mode to keep the contents in ASCII format.

* To enable the CICS applications to call REST APIs through the z/OS Connect EE server, [the communication stub in the CICS region needs to be configured](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/configuring/config_cics_commstub.html). This requires setting up the following resources: TDQUEUE, URIMAP, and PROGRAM. Below is a sample URIMAP definition that handles HTTP client requests from the communication stub to the z/OS Connect EE server. In the sample, the same z/OS Connect EE server is used for the inbound request (API Provider) and outbound request (API Requester).

  ```sh
  zconbt -p=claims.properties -f=claims.ara
  ```

## Testing the sample API

At this point, the sample API is now ready for testing. Start by testing the REST API that is called from the CICS application.

On a browser, type the following for an **Accepted** health insurance claim:

  ```text
  https://yt-claims-multi-arch-yt-zosconnect-demo.ytcluster01-tor01-m3c-4x3-fb24546bc9d850e9e034b4027bf0ce8c-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/claims/claim/rule?claimType=MEDICAL&claimAmount=100.00
  ```

This will return the following results:

  ```json
  {
   "claimType": "MEDICAL",
   "claimAmount": 100,
   "status": "Accepted",
   "reason": "Normal claim"
  }
  ```

and type the following for a **Rejected** health insurance claim.

  ```text
  https://yt-claims-multi-arch-yt-zosconnect-demo.ytcluster01-tor01-m3c-4x3-fb24546bc9d850e9e034b4027bf0ce8c-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/claims/claim/rule?claimType=MEDICAL&claimAmount=350.00
  ```

This will return the following results:

  ```json
  {
    "claimType": "MEDICAL",
    "claimAmount": 350,
    "status": "Rejected",
    "reason": "Amount exceeded 300.00. Claim require further review."
  }
  ```
  
**NOTE:** If you prefer to run the health claim business rule locally, you can get the sample source code (sample-3.js) provided in the [GitHub Sample on Node.js clients](https://github.com/zosconnect/sample-nodejs-clients).

Next step is to test the CICS sample application that calls the health insurance claim REST API.

To test the API using the z/OS Connect EE API Editor, refer to the section on [Examining, testing, starting and stopping an API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/com.ibm.zosconnect.doc/designing/api_edit_view_start_stop.html) section of the z/OS Connect EE documentation in the IBM Knowledge Center.  

Use the **POST** action in the **cicsClaimsAPI** and specify the following values to get a status of **Accepted** from the health insurance claim REST API call:

* Type **00000001** under **claimID**
* Type **MEDICAL** under **claimType**
* Type **100.00** under **claimAmount**
* Type **01/01/2020** under **serviceDate**
* Type **AMBULANCE** under **Description**
* Type **GENERAL HOSPITAL** under **ServiceProvider**

To test the API using **curl**, type the following:

  ```sh
  curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{"CICSClaimsServiceOperation":{"CLAIMCI0_CONT":{"REQ_CLAIM_CONTAINER":{"REQ_CLAIM_RECORD":{"REQ_CLAIM_DETAILS":{"ClaimType":"MEDICAL","ClaimAmount":100,"ServiceDate":"01/01/2020","Description":"AMBULANCE","ServiceProvider":"GENERAL HOSPITAL"}}}}}}' 'http://<hostname>:<port>/cics/health/claims/00000001'
  ```

Below is the sample output, note that the **ClaimStatus** field was set to **OKAY**. This is the value set by the CICS application when the claim is **Accepted**.

  ```json
  {
    "CICSClaimsServiceOperationResponse": {
      "CLAIMCI0_CONT": {
        "RSP_CLAIM_CONTAINER": {
          "OutputMessage": "SUCCESS: CLAIM RECORD SUBMITTED FOR 00000001",
          "CICSResponseCode": 0,
          "CICSResponseCode2": 0,
          "RSP_CLAIM_RECORD": {
            "ClaimID": "00000001",
            "RSP_CLAIM_DETAILS": {
              "ClaimAmount": 100,
              "ServiceDate": "01/01/2020",
              "Description": "AMBULANCE",
              "ServiceProvider": "GENERAL HOSPITAL",
              "ClaimStatus": "OKAY",
              "ClaimType": "MEDICAL"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Use the **POST** action in the **cicsClaimsAPI** and specify the following values to get a status of **Rejected** from the health insurance claim REST API call:

* Type **00000002** under **claimID**
* Type **MEDICAL** under **claimType**
* Type **250.00** under **claimAmount**
* Type **01/02/2020** under **serviceDate**
* Type **DOCTOR VISIT** under **Description**
* Type **DR JOHN DOE** under **ServiceProvider**

To test the API using **curl**, type the following:

  ```sh
  curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{"CICSClaimsServiceOperation":{"CLAIMCI0_CONT":{"REQ_CLAIM_CONTAINER":{"REQ_CLAIM_RECORD":{"REQ_CLAIM_DETAILS":{"ClaimType":"MEDICAL","ClaimAmount":250,"ServiceDate":"01/02/2020","Description":"DOCTOR VISIT","ServiceProvider":"DR JOHN DOE"}}}}}}' 'http://<hostname>:<port>/cics/health/claims/00000002'
  ```

Below is the sample output, note that the **ClaimStatus** field was set to **PEND**. This is the value set by the CICS application when the claim is **Rejected**.

  ```json
  {
    "CICSClaimsServiceOperationResponse": {
      "CLAIMCI0_CONT": {
        "RSP_CLAIM_CONTAINER": {
          "OutputMessage": "SUCCESS: CLAIM RECORD SUBMITTED FOR 00000002",
          "CICSResponseCode": 0,
          "CICSResponseCode2": 0,
          "RSP_CLAIM_RECORD": {
            "ClaimID": "00000002",
            "RSP_CLAIM_DETAILS": {
              "ClaimAmount": 250,
              "ServiceDate": "01/02/2020",
              "Description": "DOCTOR VISIT",
              "ServiceProvider": "DR JOHN DOE",
              "ClaimStatus": "PEND",
              "ClaimType": "MEDICAL"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
